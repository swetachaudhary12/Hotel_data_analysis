Problem Statement:
AtliQ Grands, a prominent player in the hospitality industry with multiple five-star hotels across India, has been facing challenges in retaining its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. Due to strategic moves from competitors and ineffective decision-making, the company's performance has declined over the past few years. As a strategic move to regain their market position and revenue, the managing director aims to leverage "Business and Data Intelligence." However, the company lacks an in-house data analytics team to provide the necessary insights.

Objective:
The objective of this project is to analyze historical data and provide actionable insights to AtliQ Grands, enabling them to make informed decisions and revitalize their performance in the luxury/business hotels segment.
