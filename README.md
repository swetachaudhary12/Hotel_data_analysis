Problem Statement:
AtliQ Grands, a prominent player in the hospitality industry with multiple five-star hotels across India, has been facing challenges in retaining its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. Due to strategic moves from competitors and ineffective decision-making, the company's performance has declined over the past few years. As a strategic move to regain their market position and revenue, the managing director aims to leverage "Business and Data Intelligence." However, the company lacks an in-house data analytics team to provide the necessary insights.

Objective:
The objective of this project is to analyze historical data and provide actionable insights to AtliQ Grands, enabling them to make informed decisions and revitalize their performance in the luxury/business hotels segment.



Dashboard:
A comprehensive data visualization dashboard will be created using a suitable tool (Power BI, or Excel). The dashboard will include interactive charts, graphs, and tables to present the analyzed metrics in a visually appealing and easy-to-understand format. It will enable stakeholders to gain quick insights into the hotel's performance.

Conclusion:
This project aims to provide AtliQ Grands with valuable data-driven insights to support their decision-making process and regain market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels segment. The findings will be presented in a concise and impactful manner to guide the company towards making strategic and effective choices for its future growth.
